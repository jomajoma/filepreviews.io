<p>The FilePreviews.io service is composed of a very simple API. There are two endpoints that can be used to request a preview, which happens asynchronously. They both work similarly but are useful for different scenarios and is organized around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>.</p>

<p>We support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">cross-origin resource sharing</a> to allow you to interact securely with your API from a client-side web application. <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.</p>

<h4>Libraries</h4>
<p>Libraries are <a href="/libraries/">available in several languages</a>.</p>

<h4>Versioning</h4>
<p>Currently, the FilePreviews API is versioned with a URL segment, such as /v1/. The current production version of the API is Version 1, so your calls should use /v1/ as the version segment.</p>

<h4>API Endpoint</h4>
<p><code>https://api.filepreviews.io/v1/</code></p>
