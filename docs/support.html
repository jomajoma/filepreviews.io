<p>We're always happy to help with code or other questions you might have. There are a few channels for getting support:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email</strong> - <a href="mailto:support@getblimp.com">support@getblimp.com</a></li>
  <li><strong>Live Chat</strong> - <a href="http://www.hipchat.com/ggkkpDG4E">Blimp Support Chat Room</a></li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/Blimp">@Blimp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're looking for support on a specific library, check the documentation specific to that client. Several clients are maintained by the Blimp team, whereas others are not. Most libraries have their own bug tracker, which is generally where the code is hosted (i.e. on GitHub).</p>
