<p>For deeper and tigther integrations with FilePreviews we recommed using webhooks. Webhooks let you register a URL that we will POST anytime we have results for requests previews.</p>

<p>Webhooks can be configured in each of your application's settings under <strong>Callback URL</strong>.</p>

<p>Webhook data is sent as plain text in the request's body as a <a href="http://jwt.io/">JSON Web Token</a>, which is digitally signed using your application's <strong>Secret Key</strong>. You can use one of many available <a href="http://jwt.io/#libraries">libraries</a> to decode the JWT with the same Secret Key. Using JWT allows you to make sure that the contents that are posted to your callback URL are from a trusted source and that they haven't been tampered with.</p>

<p>Webhooks will be sent from the following IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>107.170.102.37</li>
</ul>

<p>We might occasionally have to adjust this list of IP addresses without any advance notice, we strongly recommend against using IP-based access control to protect your webhook endpoints. Instead, we recommend serving your webhook endpoint over SSL, embedding a secret identifier in the webhook URL that is only known to you and FilePreviews.</p>
