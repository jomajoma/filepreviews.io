<p>For deeper and tigther integrations with FilePreviews we recommed using webhooks. Webhooks let you register a URL that we will POST anytime we have results for requests previews.</p>

<p>Webhooks can be configured in each of your application's settings under <strong>Callback URL</strong>.</p>

<p>Webhook data is sent as plain text in the request's body as a <a href="http://jwt.io/">JSON Web Token</a>.</p>

<p>Webhooks will be sent from the following IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>107.170.102.37</li>
</ul>

<p>We might occasionally have to adjust this list of IP addresses without any advance notice, we strongly recommend against using IP-based access control to protect your webhook endpoints. Instead, we recommend serving your webhook endpoint over SSL, embedding a secret identifier in the webhook URL that is only known to you and FilePreviews.</p>
